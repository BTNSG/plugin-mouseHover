## Overview

This activates the Runtime event listener that's used by the plugin to check for hover events. Note that the plugin is activated by default when you `require` it. You'd only ever have to call this function if you had previously deactivated the plugin by using [mouseHover.deactivate()](deactivate.markdown)



## Syntax

	mouseHover.activate( )


## Examples

``````lua
local myMouseHover = require 'plugin.mouseHover' -- the plugin is activated by default. 

-- 2,032 lines of code later

myMouseHover.deactivate() -- this removes the plugin's Runtime listener

-- 5,421 lines later

myMouseHover.activate() -- this adds the plugin's Runtime listener back again


``````
